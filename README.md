## Welcome to GitHub Page about IT!
This Article will be me explaining how i started using computers and electronics and IT over the whole world!

Ever since i was a kid i've dreamed of owning my own computer. I have always loved video games espcially when I had my Xbox 360. We came from a poor neighboor hood and at the time my mom got hit in a trafic Accident. The doctors didn't say much exepct that she probably won't make it. I was always scared and playing video games and watching videos on the internet made me escape reality and it was the best times for me. I used to love school at that time it was like a routin wake up, go to school and after school visit mom in the hospital and after that go home and play video games. Being young means no responsibility and that meaning I could do almost anything that i wanted. So I could sit home and play video games all day without woring about anything.

What about now?
Now im always stresed and woried i barely play video games but it all changed when i got my first PC that my mom and dad bought me and i've always wanted one for a long time. I stayed up all night playing fortnite and CS:GO just having fun and it feelt like i was a kid again with no responsibility but the truth is that i was just escaping reality because of how woried i was. My life now is tough, i over think everythink and i just want to be in my own zone/Bubble. So i stopped going to school for a while and i started to work own myself and gaining motivation to work in school and going to the gym again. Now im here working on myself going to school and working on this project. Not gonna lie it is tough waking up and going to school but i know that it will all pay of in the end hopefully.

IT/Dubai
Ever since i got my PC i've been opsesed with learning new things about IT and technology. I can't emagine how the world would look 100 years from now. Think about how will the phones look? or even The buildings? For an exampel take it from Dubai my first time i was there was in 2017 and i went there this year in 2021 December and wow! The city has made a huge change the buildings the technology the burj khalifa had a device like a TV. It's called the LED Show it can change the skyscrapers colors from the outside like making it purple it can even make signs like A huge Adidas logo over the whole skyscraper one time when i was there the text changed from English to arabic to Chinese. If this is now then imagine how the world would look in about 50 years. The whole city of dubai changed in 4 years there where so many new buildings and malls. But with what I know is that the people in dubai struggle a lot in work. They work super hard and some of the workers se it as tourture and thats why I didn't want to move to Dubai. I've read a lot of articles about builders and engineers. They are expat workers and the whole city is built on it. Don't get me wrong I love Dubai but there are a lot of dark sides. There are so many poor people there. I saw plenty of poor people slepping on the ground and asking for money to eat.
