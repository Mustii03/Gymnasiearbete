Ever since i was a kid i've dreamed of owning my own computer. I have always loved video games espcially when I had my Xbox 360. We came from a poor neighboor hood and at the time my mom got hit in a trafic Accident. The doctors didn't say much exepct that she probably won't make it. I was always scared and playing video games and watching videos on the internet made me escape reality and it was the best times for me. I used to love school at that time it was like a routin wake up, go to school and after school visit mom in the hospital and after that go home and play video games. Being young means no responsibility and that meaning I could do almost anything that i wanted.
