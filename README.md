## Welcome to GitHub Page about Electrical stuff in the future
T
his Article will be me explaining how i started using computers and electronics, IT, The future of electircal stuff such as flying cars, electrical cars and Buildings.

Ever since i was a kid i've dreamed of owning my own computer. I have always loved video games espcially when I had my Xbox 360. We came from a poor neighboor hood and at the time my mom got hit in a trafic Accident. The doctors didn't say much exepct that she probably won't make it. I was always scared and playing video games and watching videos on the internet made me escape reality and it was the best times for me. I used to love school at that time it was like a routin wake up, go to school and after school visit mom in the hospital and after that go home and play video games. Being young means no responsibility and that meaning I could do almost anything that i wanted. So I could sit home and play video games all day without woring about anything.

What about now?
Now im always stresed and woried i barely play video games but it all changed when i got my first PC that my mom and dad bought me and i've always wanted one for a long time. I stayed up all night playing fortnite and CS:GO just having fun and it feelt like i was a kid again with no responsibility but the truth is that i was just escaping reality because of how woried i was. My life now is tough, i over think everythink and i just want to be in my own zone/Bubble. So i stopped going to school for a while and i started to work own myself and gaining motivation to work in school and going to the gym again. Now im here working on myself going to school and working on this project. Not gonna lie it is tough waking up and going to school but i know that it will all pay of in the end hopefully.

IT/Dubai
Ever since i got my PC i've been opsesed with learning new things about IT and technology. I can't emagine how the world would look 100 years from now. Think about how will the phones look? or even The buildings? For an exampel take it from Dubai my first time i was there was in 2017 and i went there this year in 2021 December and wow! The city has made a huge change the buildings the technology the burj khalifa had a device like a TV. It's called the LED Show it can change the skyscrapers colors from the outside like making it purple it can even make signs like A huge Adidas logo over the whole skyscraper one time when i was there the text changed from English to arabic to Chinese. If this is now then imagine how the world would look in about 50 years. The whole city of dubai changed in 4 years there where so many new buildings and malls. But with what I know is that the people in dubai struggle a lot in work. They work super hard and some of the workers se it as tourture and thats why I didn't want to move to Dubai. I've read a lot of articles about builders and engineers. They are expat workers and the whole city is built on it. Don't get me wrong I love Dubai but there are a lot of dark sides. There are so many poor people there. I saw plenty of poor people slepping on the ground and asking for money to eat. I've been looking around for jobs in dubai in the IT department and i found a bunch of jobs I will link the website down.

Electrical cars: I've not always liked electrical cars but now i actually do and thats mostly thanks to that you never have to pay for gas again. Almost all cars will be electical in the future and thats because there won't be any more petrol and electrical cars are more eco friendly. Plus you can always charge your car in your house and when your out. The only downside is that they're expensive to purchase. But i think that they'll be less expensive when time pases and new cars come out because electrical cars are still pretty new and a lot of people still drive petrol. Plus think about that there will probably be tons of charging stations every where and companies are probably working on way faster charging for cars. Electical cars don't even take a lot of time to charge like a tesla. A Tesla can be fully charged in around 30+ minutes.

Flying Cars! 

We coverd electrical cars but not flying ones. Flying cars have been talked about a lot and people really want see it. According to CNBC flying cars could be available in 2024 https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/flying-cars-could-be-commercially-available-in-2024-tech-firm-ceo.html. But the question is what do you need to be able to drive one. We still aren't sure because of the trafic laws. And you can't just have a bunch of flying cars flying around at least not now. Imagine if one crashed into a building or if one just stops working and drops down and what about the laws, can you just fly one without regulations and not worry about other flying cars? Trafic lights? Flying rules? Flying Expenses? Purchasing one? Rechargeble?
